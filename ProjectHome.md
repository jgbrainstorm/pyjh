I put some of my python packages into this project. These packages includes:
  * gmbcg cluster finding (gmbcg)
  * Error corrected Gaussian Mixture Model (ecgmm)
  * Image PSF measurements (ImageQuality)
  * Making color images and converting images to Google KML file (desGoogleEarth)
  * CCD image analysis tool (decamFermi)
  * Other convenient tools (pyhao)

I recommend you git clone them using a programming tool such as eclipse. Comments/requests sent to jianganghao@gmail.com
