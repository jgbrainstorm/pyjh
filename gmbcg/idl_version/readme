0. The input catalog should be in fit file format. Exactly specified as here:
https://sites.google.com/site/descwg/Home/des-cluster-finders/cluster-runs/mock_format.

However, if you want to run on the truth table, you need to change the rungmbcg.pro file to use the one with /truth keyword. 

#---------the following is the directions about how to run it--------------

1. in the config file, change the input directory and output directory. Please do not add any space when you do the changes. Just replace the directory part.

2. Specify a radius in the config file. This is the searching aperture, in unit of Mpc. I put 1.0 Mpc for example.

3. In command line, type: idl rungmbcg

4. It is done!

#-------output files-------

There are several output files:
       des_mock_v1.00_BCG_blended_gmbcg_v2.5.fit
       des_mock_v1.00_BCG_gmbcg_v2.5.fit
       des_mock_v1.00_BCG_gmbcg_v2.5_stripe_0.fit
       des_mock_v1.00_BCGMB_gmbcg_v2.5_stripe_0.fit
       des_mock_v1.00_gmbcg_Hao.fit

Only the des_mock_v1.00_gmbcg_Hao.fit is for the analysis pipeline. HDU1 is for the BCG list. HDU 2 is for members. HDU0 is nothing. 
See: https://sites.google.com/site/descwg/Home/des-cluster-finders/cluster-runs/mock_format

for details of the format.
